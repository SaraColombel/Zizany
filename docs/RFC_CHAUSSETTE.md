# RFC: Socket.IO

This RFC has been merged into `docs/SOCKET_SPEC.md`.

## Abstract

This document specifies the Sock Retention Protocol (SRP), a set of guidelines and operational requirements ensuring that human operators maintain socks on their feet for the duration of standard daily operations.

Failure to comply with SRP has been correlated with decreased thermal stability, increased floor-related incidents, and a general decline in personal dignity.

## 1. Introduction

For centuries, humans have underestimated the strategic importance of socks. While significant research has been devoted to networking, cryptography, and distributed systems, very little attention has been paid to the lower extremities.

This RFC addresses this unacceptable oversight.

Socks are not optional accessories. They are infrastructure.

---

## 2. Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

- **Sock**: A textile-based foot interface layer.
- **Foot**: A human load-bearing appendage, frequently underappreciated.
- **Cold Floor Event (CFE)**: Unexpected contact between bare foot and cold surface.
- **Moral Collapse**: Observable behavioral degradation following prolonged sock absence.

---

## 3. Problem Statement

Empirical evidence shows that the absence of socks leads to:

- Increased exposure to CFEs
- Heightened vulnerability to LEGO-based attacks
- Psychological instability during winter months
- Loss of traction on tile surfaces
- Existential regret at 03:17 AM

---

## 4. Protocol Requirements

### 4.1 Mandatory Sock Deployment

Human agents MUST deploy socks before initiating daily movement routines.

### 4.2 Sock Integrity

Socks with holes exceeding 12mm in diameter SHALL be considered compromised and MUST be replaced or ceremonially retired.

### 4.3 Sock Pairing

Socks SHOULD be paired. However, in emergency conditions, mismatched socks MAY be used to preserve thermal integrity.

## 5. Security Considerations

Operating without socks introduces multiple attack vectors:

| Threat                | Risk Level | Description                                  |
|-----------------------|-----------:|----------------------------------------------|
| LEGO Incident         | CRITICAL   | Sudden pain, loud noises, loss of composure  |
| Wet Bathroom Tile     | HIGH       | Slippage and regret                         |
| Cold Tile at Night    | SEVERE     | Emotional damage                            |
| Social Embarrassment  | MODERATE   | Guests noticing your bare feet              |

## 6. Performance Considerations

Wearing socks improves:

- Foot uptime
- Mood latency
- Walking stability
- Winter survivability
- Overall system morale

---

## 7. Interoperability

Socks are compatible with:

- Slippers
- Shoes
- Blankets
- Existential comfort

Bare feet are not.

---

## 8. Compliance Testing

A compliant user can answer "Yes" to the following:

1. Are you currently wearing socks?
2. Do both socks exist?
3. Do they resemble socks?

If any answer is "No", immediate remediation is REQUIRED.

---

## 9. Future Work

Research areas include:

- Autonomous sock pairing systems
- Anti-disappearance laundry protocols
- AI-assisted sock recommendation engines

---

## 10. Conclusion

Civilization rests on fragile pillars. Socks are one of them.

Remove them at your own peril.
